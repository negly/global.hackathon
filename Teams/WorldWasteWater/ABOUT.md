Our project
==========================
Comming from 5 countries in 4 continents, we are a global team. Therefore, we had to choose a global problem to solve:
**The waste of water**
It's the only problem, that affects everybody; 
and the only problem, that could be solved by everyone

We're going to show a map where you can see and report cases of wastes water in your country, besides we're going to teach how to reduce waste water in your daily life.
